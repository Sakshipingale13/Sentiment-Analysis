Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. It's a crucial task in NLP because understanding the sentiment of text helps in understanding opinions, emotions, and attitudes expressed by people towards entities, topics, or events.


Classification: Sentiment analysis typically involves classifying text into categories such as positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. Some applications may have more fine-grained categories like very positive, positive, neutral, negative, and very negative.
